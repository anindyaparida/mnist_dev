Scikit-learn mnist dataset

File name : Plot_graph.py

Here I observe that, on implementing SVM and Decision Tree algorithm on the mnist dataset  I achieve the following accuracy and F1 score.
SVM            	8x8	0.001	85.0:15.0	0.956	0.955
Decision Tree  	8x8	0.001	85.0:15.0	0.607	0.531

SVM has a better accuracy and F1 score.
